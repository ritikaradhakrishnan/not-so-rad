        If It Smells Like Silicon…How to Spot AI Generated Content in the Wild
      </h2>
      <p>
        <em>Artificially Intelligent and Fundamentally Flawed</em>
      </p>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Let’s face it, AI is everywhere. You must probably be wondering if this
        article has a chat gpt-esque Je ne sais quoi to it. (It does not).
      </p>
      <p>
        Two years ago, someone close to me wrote me a birthday letter on how
        proud they were of me and the person I was. I kept it. I believed it.
        Only for months later for them to admit that it was all ChatGPT. All of
        it. That’s when I stopped and realized it’s everywhere. HELP ME. IT'S
        EVERYWHERE.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because I have been an avid LLM user I know what an unedited AI
        generated response looks like, or as I like to call gpt-esque response.
        Please keep in mind that there are people who write like this and this
        is not a sign for anyone to stop their natural form of expression. So
        here’s my top 5 ways to spot AI writing.
      </p>
      <h3>1. The "Not only ___ but also __" structure</h3>
      <p>
        This is imperial English. I used to write like this when I went to
        catholic school. What feels natural to me is<code>
          “She writes and she also sings”,</code
        >
        rather than
        <code
          >"Not only does she write my lord… she also sings, your grace".</code
        >
      </p>
      <h3>2. Some Words are Red-Flags</h3>
      <p>
        Words like delving, diving, dive into, a testament to, realm. I saw a
        list on the internet containing gpt-esque (yes, I am making this word a
        thing) words but then you would have to include the entire dictionary if
        every word sets off an AI alarm.
      </p>
      <h3>3. The three word pattern : __, __ and ___</h3>
      <p>
        <code>My pet fish is my best friend, colleague and my dinner.</code>
        You may think, "Meh, this isn’t gpt-esque...these are mere adjectives",
        but when you see one in the wild you will know exactly what I mean. Take
        this gem, for example.
        <code>This is a testament to not only my grit but also my ability to be strong, hardworking and humble.</code>
      
        To me, this sentence isn't just telling me about how the person is but
        rather trying to convince me about it.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Why Say It When You Can Ask It Back?</h3>
      <p>
        LLMs have a tendency to ask unnecessary questions and sound almost like
        customer support because of how they are trained. While this may seem
        supportive and friendly, it tends to add unnecessary rhetorical
        sentences. Instead of cutting straight to the answer, they might frame
        it with mini-dialogue cues like:
        <code>
          "The result?” “So, what does this mean?” “Let’s break it down.” “The
          answer to this is…”
        </code>
        This kind of delay in the information can feel like trying to mic human
        conversational patterns.
      </p>
      <h3>5. Dash on 'em</h3>
      <p>
        By far the most annoying and the most gpt-esque of them all. I read a
        sentence with something along the lines of ‘It’s not just alpha — it’s
        bravo’ and I know Miss GPT worked her magic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep in mind that there are folks who write and this and in no way it
        automatically means that it’s an LLM generated text. These points are
        just a dead giveaway that it might be an AI.
      </p>
      <h4>
        You are probably wondering if this blog was written by AI. But given the
        chaotic grammar and tragic sentence structure yeah, it’s definitely all
        me. Not AI. Just an unfiltered human with thumbs and a Notes app.
